## Exported Data Format

Each recording session exports a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "unique-session-id",
  "startTime": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "endTime": "2024-01-15T10:35:00.000Z",
  "interactions": [
    {
      "sequenceNumber": 1,
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
      "type": "click",
      "interaction": {
        "type": "click",
        "coordinates": { "x": 234, "y": 456 },
        "mouseButton": "left"
      },
      "element": {
        "tagName": "button",
        "type": "submit",
        "text": "Submit Order",
        "html": "<button class='btn-primary'>Submit Order</button>",
        "attributes": { ... },
        "computedStyles": { ... },
        "selectors": {
          "id": "#submit-btn",
          "css": ".btn-primary",
          "xpath": "//button[@id='submit-btn']",
          "text": "button:contains('Submit Order')"
        }
      },
      "context": {
        "url": "https://example.com/checkout",
        "pageTitle": "Checkout - Example Store",

        "formContext": { ... }
      },
      "screenshots": {

        "after": "data:image/png;base64,..."

## Development

### Phase 1 (Completed)
- âœ… Basic Chrome extension structure with Manifest V3
- âœ… Core interaction recording (clicks, keyboard, forms)
- âœ… Screenshot capture functionality
- âœ… Basic DOM context capture
- âœ… Popup UI for recording controls
- âœ… Export to JSON format

### Phase 2 (In Progress)
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced selector generation strategies
- ðŸ”„ Improved element classification
- ðŸ”„ Storage optimization for large sessions

### Phase 3 (Planned)
- Smart element classification
- Interaction grouping and workflow detection
- Natural language processing improvements

### Phase 4 (Planned)
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced privacy features
- Integration with test generation systems

## Known Limitations

- Screenshots are captured using Chrome's tab capture API (may not work on some protected pages)
- Storage is limited to Chrome's local storage quota
- Some dynamic elements may require additional handling

## Privacy & Security

- All data is stored locally in the browser
- No external connections are made
- Sensitive data masking can be enabled in settings
- Extension requires explicit user action to start recording
